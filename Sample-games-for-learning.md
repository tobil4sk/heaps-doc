# Sample games for learning

This section is about samples that actually show how to finally use the Heaps API to make ***very basic*** games.

You can also use these as templates or starting points to make your own game!

---
1. [[Copy & paste game templates]] *(copy/paste and ready to go!)*

2. [[Sample games with resources]] *(these include game assets/resources, e.g. sprites, sounds, music)*
